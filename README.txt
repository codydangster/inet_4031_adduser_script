Purpose: The purpose of this python script is to create user accounts. The python script will read inputs from standard input 
and create numerous user accounts based on the information from the document.

Process on how to run code:
- User must download both python and input files from github repository
- User must have a createuser directory created and transfer files to directory
- User will run certain commands to add users to groups
- First command: ~/createuser$ grep user0 /etc/passwd
- Second command: ~/createuser$ grep user0 /etc/group
- Third command: ~/createuser$ id user05

Conclusion: User should be able to see all users being added to groups displayed in terminal.
